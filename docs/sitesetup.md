# How I Built This Site

This is a GH pages site built using Material for MkDocs. This post will walk you through how I created it and contribute to it.

## Starting From Scratch
<small>Adapted from [Getting Started with MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/) and [Getting Start fot Materials for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/)</small>

pip install mkdocs
